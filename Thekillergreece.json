				"patchnotes": "--- 4.6 Version ---\n- NEW: Some lore pieces. They can be found solely at certain stores and big buildings.\n- Added loose spawn spots in every region, including the new DLC region(s).\n- Expanded the loot tables to add more opportunities to loot items from containers.\n- Added a large abundance of loot in interiors that make sense such as big houses, stores, etc.\n- Nerfed/buffed certain food and drink items' calories. Made certain strong food/drink items to spawn much rare.\n\nFood items will be rarely found in cars, caves, etc, or in places where they wouldn't make much sense. This food pack will work excellently with Waltz's Food Pack.",
